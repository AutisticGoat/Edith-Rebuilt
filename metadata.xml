    <description>[h1] WARNING: THIS MOD REQUIRES [url=https://repentogon.com/]REPENTOGON[/url] TO WORK [/h1]
[h2] A whole rework and expansion of the cut classic from Antibirth: Edith [/h2]
Edith: Rebuilt is a mod that brings back Edith, the cut character from Antibirth, with a complete rework that resembles the classic Antibirth gameplay style, a full set of unlocks, and a Tainted counterpart

[h3][b]Main Features[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*][b]Reworked gameplay:[/b] Enjoy a refined character experience, without feeling too different from Antibirth's experience
[*][b]Over 25 unlocks:[/b] Over 15 items, 4 trinkets, 2 challenges, and more, including an unlock method even for Edith and a Tainted counterpart
[/list]

[h3][b]Rebuilt Edith:[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*][b]Controled jump:[/b] Now Edith's jump is controlled by a button instead of being automatic, giving her more control
[*][b]Two types of stomps:[/b] Protect yourself with defensive stomps (by holding the jump button) and counterattack with classic ofensive stomps
[*][b]Salt the enemies:[/b] Use defensive stomps to apply a brand new status effect  which slows enemies and weakens them
[*][b]Take advantage of stats:[/b] Now stats have more interaction with stomping, Reduce stomp cooldown with high speed, increase stomp radius with range, and stomp's knockback with shotspeed
[*][b]Only tears:[/b] Edith is unable to use other weapons rather than tears (this means no brimstone, no mom's knife, no spirit sword, etc), but this can be circumvented with...
[*][b]Stomp Synergies:[/b] Over 20 stomp synergies and more to come with updates
[*][b]Birthright effect:[/b] Enhance stomps and their synergies with Edith's birthright effect, Super Stomps
[/list]

[h3][b]Tainted Edith:[/b][/h3]
You know, i don't think it would be good if i explain how does Tainted Edith works, go to unlock her and discover it by yourself, i [url=https://youtu.be/EUJOp8AdBkg][b]hop[/b]e [/url] you enjoy playing with her as much as i did designing here

[h3][b]Mod Compatibility:[/b][/h3]
Mod compatibility isn't as great as I expected to be on release, but this will be worked on, current supported mods are:
- Birthcake: Rebaked


[h3]Possible questions:[/h3]

[b]Where are the costumes?[/b]
This mod was made by a pretty small team, where the 90% of the stuff was made by only 1 person (the coder), if we manage to get more help, there will be an updated exclusively dedicated to costumes

[b]Why is mod support so poor?[/b]
Once again, this mod was almost enterily made by 1 person, which isn't exactly the best in mental stability, but don't worry, i'll improve mod support with future updates

[b]What will happen to Edith: Vestige?[/b]
Edith Vestige will remain on the workshop as a demo for this mod, i don't think i will update it again tho, but i won't take it down

[b]Why another Edith, aren't there like already 5?[/b]
Yeah, i know there are a lot of Ediths, but i've been working on this since september 2022 and wanted to release it, sorry for 

[b]There will be a Tarnished Edith?[/b]
Yes! I already have an raw idea of  how Tarnished Edith will behave, but she will be added in the future
