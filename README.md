Edith: Rebuilt is a mod for TBOI: Repentance+ which brings back the cut character from Antibirth, Edith, with a good amount of QoL changes, a full set of unlocks and a tainted counterpart

Requirements:
- TBOI: Repentance+ v1.9.7.12
- Repentogon+ (Right now RGON+ isn't released, so use nightly builds instead: https://nightly.link/TeamREPENTOGON/REPENTOGON/workflows/ci/main/REPENTOGON-main.zip)
